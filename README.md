# E-Commerce Project

## Description

This E-Commerce project is built using the MEARN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). It provides a comprehensive platform for managing products in an online store, secured with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for robust authentication and authorization. The application features four main pages: **Add Product**, **Update Product**, **Product List**, and **Home**. 

## Features

- **Add Product**: A user-friendly interface for adding new products to the store. Administrators can input product details such as name, price, category and company.

- **Update Product**: Allows administrators to edit existing product information. This ensures that product details are always up-to-date.

- **Product List**: Displays all available products in the form of table. Users can view product details, and search for specific product.

- **Home**: The landing page that showcases featured products and provides navigation to other sections of the application.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database to store product information.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js that handles server-side logic and API routes.
- **React.js**: A front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces, allowing for a dynamic and responsive experience.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime that enables server-side programming and handles API requests.
